>A Base-Motif Fractal is a self-similar shape, or fractal, determined by two shapes: a base curve, and a motif. The base curve is not a "curve" in the ordinary sense of a curve; in fact, it is composed of straight lines. To produce the associated fractal, we translate, rotate, and scale the motif, also composed of straight lines, and replace each of the lines in the base curve with a transformed, but geometrically similar, motif. We do the same thing with the resulting curve, again and again, to infinity. Let's see this process in action on an example base curve and motif.
