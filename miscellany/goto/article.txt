Whenever usage of <strong>goto</strong> in C or C++ arises in discussion, people are heatedly split upon whether its use is ever merited. Despite numerous efforts against its usage, most famously Dijkstra's essay "<a href="https://homepages.cwi.nl/~storm/teaching/reader/Dijkstra68.pdf">Go To Statement Considered Harmful</a>", the goto statement enjoys use, even widespread use, in large codebases. In this article I seek to present some information and research about both sides of the argument, hopefully for your own pleasure and codeâ€™s benefit.
