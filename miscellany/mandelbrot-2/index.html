            The Mandelbrot set; one of the most famous fractals (and, really, mathematical objects) of all time. It's striking, really, in how complex it is (pun not intended), yet how simple the rules are. Let's delve deeper into the Mandelbrot set and, hopefully, learn something new. If you're new to the ideas of fractals in the complex plane, you can see my intro <a href="../0001/">here</a>.

            ::fig::images/mandelbrot.png::Mandelbrot Set  (Real axis: [-2.5,1.5], Imaginary axis: [-2,2], 500 iterations.)::Figure 1: The Mandelbrot set.::

            First, let's precisely define the Mandelbrot set. Define a function \(f_c(z)=z^2+c\). The Mandelbrot set is the set of all complex numbers \(c\) such that when the function is iterated, starting at \(c\), the resulting sequence's magnitude does not diverge to infinity.

            Let's get some idea of scale for the Mandelbrot set. Here's another image overlayed on top of a grid with 0.1 units between lines.

            ::fig::images/mandelbrot1.jpg::Mandelbrot Set  (Real axis: [-2.5,1.5], Imaginary axis: [-2,2], 500 iterations.)::Figure 2: The Mandelbrot set, with critical points labelled.::

            As we can see, the Mandelbrot set is relatively compact. The entire set lies within a radius of 2 of the origin (which we'll prove in a moment). The cardioid, or the sideways heart-like portion of the set, has height \(3\sqrt{3}/4\) and width \(9/8\), with its cusp at the point \((1/4,0)\). The circular portion to its left is just that -- a perfect circle -- with center \((-1,0)\) and radius \(1/4\). The largest (by far) "mini-brot" is centered at \((-7/4,0)\). There are many other shapes in the Mandelbrot set, but besides those in mini-brots, they are not easily described (i.e. have much less geometrical significance). For example, the shape just to the left of the circle is somewhat circular, but it is, in fact, not a circle.

            A couple basic physical properties of the Mandelbrot set:

            <h2>The Mapping \(f_c(z)\)</h2>

            Before we continue looking at specific parts of the Mandelbrot set, let's visualize the mapping \(z=f_c(z)\) like a vector field. We'll draw lines between points and where they are mapped to to see the change. (For reference, this image is of the same scale of Figure 2.)

            ::fig::images/mandelbrot3.jpg::Paths after one iteration::Figure 3: The mapping \(f_c(z\)) applied once. Dots placed at original points.::

            It's quite a complex movement, but as you can see, there are many pairs of points that will map to the same point through \(f_c\), so it isn't that random. Let's see what happens after two iterations. (The density of points drawn is twice the number as in the previous image.)

            ::fig::images/mandelbrot4.jpg::Paths after two iterations::Figure 4: The mapping \(f_c(z\)) applied twice. Dots placed at original points.::

            That looks quite a bit more complicated. Finally, let's try going for 500 iterations. Not all points in the Mandelbrot set <em>converge</em>, in the usual sense of the term, to a specific complex number. Many of them end up in cycles. As such, the number of iterations has a significant bearing on how the figure will look, and adding just one more iteration could make the image look completely different -- that's how chaotic this process is. (In this figure, only points inside the Mandelbrot set are actually drawn.)

            ::fig::images/mandelbrot2.jpg::Paths after 500 iterations::Figure 5: The mapping \(f_c(z\)) applied \(500\) times.::

            You can definitely see a lot of the features of the Mandelbrot set now in the shapes created by the lines! The main cardioid and somewhat-circular figures to its left are quite apparent, as well as some other shapes within the Mandelbrot set.

            Let's try make a video of this mapping! We'll start off with a grid of evenly-spaced points in the complex plane and apply a single iteration of \(f_c(z)\) on each subsequent frame.

            ::vid::https://www.youtube.com/embed/luqZALSgV5c?modestbranding=1::

            At first the process is extremely chaotic, with points outside the Mandelbrot set flying out of the frame. Around the 3 second mark, however, all remaining points fall into some cycle. Not many points actually converge to a single point; in fact, the only ones that do lie in the main cardioid.

            Interestingly enough, all points that reach a magnitude greater than \(2\) somewhere during its iteration will go to \(\infty\) and remain outside the Mandelbrot set. This is because \(f_c(z)\), whenever \(|z|>2\), will always return a value with magnitude greater than \(|z|\). Therefore, for (marginally more) efficient rendering and simpler mathematical analysis, we will treat points outside the Mandelbrot set as points which, under iteration, will have a magnitude larger than \(2\).

            Let's begin to analyze the various parts of the Mandelbrot set, so that we can (hopefully) understand its complexity more fully.

            <h2>The Main Cardioid (1-cycles)</h2>

            The main cardioid is the kidney bean-shaped portion of the Mandelbrot set, highlighted here:

            ::fig::images/cardioid.jpg::Cardioid::Figure 6: The main cardioid.::

            It's sort of an odd shape, but it pops up in analytic geometry quite often. You can read more about cardioids and their properties <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardioid">here</a>.

            The cardioid corresponds to the set of complex numbers which converge to a single complex number under iteration; in other words, the cycle they fall into has length \(1\). Let's figure out the equation of this cardioid!

            The 1-cycle that a point \(c\) within the cardioid will converge to will have a single complex number, say, \(k\), which has the property that \(k=f_c(k)\) (i.e. under iteration they do nothing). But for any \(c\), there's always some complex \(k\) such that \(k=f_c(k)\)! Namely, if \(c=a+bi\), then $$k=\frac{1\pm\sqrt{1-4c}}{2}=\frac{1}{4}\left(2 \pm \sqrt{2} \sqrt{-\sqrt{16 a^2 - 8 a + 16 b^2 + 1} - 4 a + 1}\right)+\frac{b\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{-\sqrt{16 a^2 - 8 a + 16 b^2 + 1} - 4 a + 1}}i$$ works, as long as \(-\sqrt{16 a^2 - 8 a + 16 b^2 + 1} - 4a + 1 \neq 0\).

            The points \(k\) such that \(k=f_c(k)\) <em>and</em> which can be converged to are known as <strong>attractive</strong> fixed points, whereas the points \(k\) that cannot be converged to, even though \(k=f_c(k)\), are known as <strong>repelling</strong> fixed points. (They are called fixed because subsequent iterations go nowhere.) A key property of these repelling points is that for any complex \(\epsilon > 0\), iteration of \(k=f_c(k+\epsilon)\), starting at the repelling point, will result in convergence at another point. Since \(f_c(z)\) is complex differentiable everywhere, these repelling points are just the complex numbers \(k\) such that \(k=f_c(k)\) and \(\left|\frac{d}{dk}f_c(k)\right|>1\). Similarly, the attractive points are the complex numbers \(k\) such that \(k=f_c(k)\) and \(\left|\frac{d}{dk}f_c(k)\right|&lt;1\). The fixed points on the boundary between being attractive and being repelling -- when \(k=f_c(k)\) and \(\left|\frac{d}{dk}f_c(k)\right|=1\) -- are known as <strong>indifferent</strong> points. This is a direct consequence of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banach_fixed-point_theorem">Banach Fixed-Point Theorem</a> on metric spaces. Let's look at examples of each of these points.

            For an example of a repelling point, let \(c=-0.1+0.75i\). Then $$k\approx 1.26734844362335-0.488695850126816i$$ (the exact value isn't given here because it is incredibly complicated -- see the formula for \(k\) from above -- but it is algebraic by definition). As a quick check, we see that $$k^2+c\approx 1.267348443 - 0.488695850 i\approx k.$$ But \(\left|\frac{d}{dk}(k^2+c)\right|=|2k|\approx 2.71661>1\), so \(k\) is repelling. Indeed, when we iterate \(f_c(z)\), we don't converge to a single point, even though \(c\) is in the Mandelbrot set:

            ::images/iteration1.png::iterations::Figure 7: Iteration of \(f_c(z)\) for \(c=-0.1+0.75i\).::

            The cycle length for this point is \(3\); for example, iterations \(23\) and \(26\) have (roughly) the same number. We don't see our point \(k\) anywhere.

            For an example of an attractive point, let \(c=-0.2+0.4i\). Then \(k\approx -0.2252860569939+0.2757532673783i\). As a check, we see that $$k^2+c\approx -0.2252860 + 0.2757533 i\approx k.$$ But here \(\left|\frac{d}{dk}(k^2+c)\right|=|2k|\approx 0.712162&lt;1\), so \(k\) is attractive. In this case, what happens when we iterate \(f_c(z)\)?

            ::fig::images/iteration2.png::iterations::Figure 8: Iteration of \(f_c(z)\) for \(c=-0.2+0.4i\).::

            The iteration \(z=f_c(z)\) converges to our value, \(k\). Yay for attractive points!

            Now we're ready to see what the cardioid has to do with all this. Any point \(c\) which corresponds with an attractive fixed point \(k\) will converge to \(k\), a cycle length of \(1\). But our formula for \(k\) is way too complicated... what do we do? Well, <em>given</em> an attractive fixed point \(k\), we can construct what complex number \(c\) will converge to \(k\). This is much easier; since we defined \(k\) such that \(k=f_c(k)=k^2+c\), we know that \(c = k-k^2\). Let's proceed!

            Every attractive fixed point \(k\) has the mathematical property that we discussed earlier -- that \(\left|\frac{d}{dk}(k^2+c)\right|&lt;1\). We want to find the boundary between attractive and repelling fixed points, and that's just the fixed points where the magnitude of the derivative is 1 -- the indifferent points. If \(\left|\frac{d}{dk}(k^2+c)\right|=1\), then \(|2k|=1\), or \(|k|=0.5\). This just describes a circle with center at the origin and radius \(0.5\). Using polar coordinates for our complex numbers, we can describe \(k\) as \(\frac{1}{2}e^{i\theta}\) for \(0\leq \theta&lt;2\pi\).

            If \(k=\frac{1}{2}e^{i\theta}\), then using our formula for \(c\), we see that the boundary between 1-cycle points and any other point has equation \(e^{i\theta}/2-(e^{i\theta}/2)^2=e^{i\theta}/2-e^{2i\theta}/4\). Using Euler's formula, we can graph this in Desmos using the parametric equation $$\left(\frac{\cos t}{2}-\frac{\cos 2t}{4},\frac{\sin t}{2}-\frac{\sin 2t}{4}\right)$$ where \(0\leq t&lt;2\pi\):

            <h2>The Main Circle (2-cycles)</h2>

            Armed with our new classification of points, let's investigate the circle just to the left of the main cardioid:

            ::fig::images/disk1.png::circle::Figure 10: The main circle.::

            Whereas before we defined our target fixed points \(k\) such that \(k=f_c(k)\), we now need to find \(k\) such that \(k=f_c(f_c(k))\), since those will correspond to a cycle of length 2. Expanding out the polynomial, we wish to find \(k\) such that $$k=(k^2+c)^2+c=k^4+2ck^2+c^2+c,$$ so \(c^2+(2k^2+1)c+(k^4-k)=0\). Treating this as a quadratic in \(c\) and applying the quadratic formula, we see that $$c=\frac{-2k^2-1\pm\sqrt{(2k^2+1)^2-4(k^4-k)}}{2}=\frac{-2k^2-1\pm (2k+1)}{2}.$$ Thus, \(c = k-k^2\) or \(c = -k^2-k-1\). The first of these two solutions just corresponds to the main cardioid, since if \(k=f_c(k)\), \(k=f_c(f_c(k))\) as well. The second solution, however, describes something new, so let's set \(c = -k^2-k-1\).

            Since \(\left|\frac{d}{dk}f_c(f_c(k))\right|=1\) to describe the boundary between attractive and repelling fixed points, we wish to find all complex \(k\) such that $$\left|\frac{d}{dk}((k^2+c)^2+c)\right|=1.$$ Expanding out the polynomial, we find that $$\left|\frac{d}{dk}((k^2+c)^2+c)\right|=1$$ $$\left|\frac{d}{dk}(k^4+2ck^2+c^2+c)\right|=1$$ $$\left|4k(k^2+c)\right|=1.$$ This describes all \(4k(k^2+c)\) with magnitude \(1\), or a circle with radius \(1\) centered at the origin, so we can express it as \(e^{i\theta}\) for convenience: $$4k(k^2+c)=e^{i\theta}.$$

            Now, we substitute the necessary \(c\) to get a two-cycle: $$4k(k^2+(-k^2-k-1))=e^{i\theta}$$ $$4k(-k-1)=e^{i\theta}$$ $$k^2+k=-e^{i\theta}/4.$$ Since \(c=-k^2-k-1\), \(k^2+k=-c-1\), so $$-c-1=-e^{i\theta}/4$$ $$c=e^{i\theta}/4-1.$$ Applying Euler's formula, we get a parametric equation of $$\left(\frac{\cos t}{4}-1,\frac{\sin t}{4}\right),$$ where \(0 \leq t &lt; 2\pi\) and graphing it on Desmos next to the main cardioid:
