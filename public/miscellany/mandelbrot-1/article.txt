Ever since the term was introduced by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benoit_Mandelbrot" target="_blank">Benoit B. Mandelbrot</a>, "fractals" have awed so many people with their odd combination of simplicity and complexity. In this article I specifically talk about fractals in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_plane" target="_blank">complex plane</a>, but fractal geometry and its derivatives are a fascinating part of math going much beyond what I detail here, so definitely get yourself interested in that.
